﻿' Developer Express Code Central Example:
' Use only one scroll bar for a grid with multiple master/detail levels.
' 
' A grid containing a number of groups (master), each with a number of lines
' (detail) is a representation of an order which is grouped for readability. When
' a group has a greater number of lines then fits on the screen, a scrollbar is
' added to the detail-view and when there are multiple groups the master-view also
' gets a scrollbar. When the user scrolls through the grid, only the master-view
' is scrolled (unless a row is selected, then only the detail-view is scrolled)
' and it feels like the program is behaving oddly, as half the rows are
' skipped.
' To achieve this goal, we need the GridControl to have a height equal
' to the height of all content placed in a master-view. So, the scrollbar does not
' appear in either the master-view or in the detail-view. To allow scrolling, we
' need to put our GridControl into a XtraScrollableControl and set the
' GridControl.Dock property to DockStyle.Top.
' We created the MyGridControl class
' - a descendant of the GridControl. MyGridControl works with MyGridView views and
' includes the CalcGridHeight() method, which is called when the appearance of the
' Master-View is changed.
' To put MyGridControl in the XtraScrollableContainer,
' use the MyGridControl.InitScrolling() method at runtime.
' Please note that if
' you want to change Bounds or Dock properties of MyGridControl at runtime, change
' similar properties of the MyGridControl.ScrollableContainer control.
